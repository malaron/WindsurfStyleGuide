# Code Style Guide

## Variable Naming Conventions

* Use explicit type names for variable declarations.
* For single-line initialization, use the following format:
SomeClass variable = new();
* For multi-line initialization, use the following format:
SomeClass variable; variable = new SomeClass();

* Use camelCase for variable names.
* Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely recognized.

## Code Formatting

* Use 4 spaces for indentation.
* Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
* Use curly braces to enclose code blocks, even if they are single-line.

## Class and Method Naming Conventions

* Use PascalCase for class and method names.
* Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the class or method.

## Other Conventions

* Use `using` statements instead of fully qualified type names.
* Avoid using `static` classes unless necessary.
